# Cameron's Engineering Portfolio & Sandbox

Hi, I'm Cameron. I'm a software engineer who builds practical, production-ready systems.

This repository is more than just a static portfolio—it's a live, deployed sandbox where I design, build, and maintain full-stack applications. It demonstrates my ability to take a project from concept to a reliable, self-hosted production environment, balancing performance, maintainability, and iteration speed.

## What I Build

I focus on creating tools and platforms that solve real problems. This repository houses:

- **Full-Stack Applications:** Including a custom blog/vlog platform with complete CRUD capabilities, tagging, RSS, and media handling.
- **Utility Software:** Such as complex, local-first budgeting workflows and dynamic site features.
- **Production Infrastructure:** A custom backend designed for performance, reliability, and self-hosted operation.

## My Technical Stack

I choose tools that offer the best leverage for the problem at hand. My current stack includes:

- **Frontend:** React + Vite for fast, responsive user interfaces.
- **Backend:** Node.js with Hono for lightweight, high-performance API services.
- **Data:** SQLite for low-friction, local-first persistence.
- **AI Integration:** OpenAI APIs applied where they provide tangible value.
- **Infrastructure:** Ubuntu + Nginx on DigitalOcean, managed with PM2.

## How I Approach Engineering

I view software engineering as a systems design challenge, not just a feature checklist.

- **Systems Thinking:** I prioritize clean interfaces, understanding constraints, and anticipating failure modes alongside the final user experience.
- **End-to-End Ownership:** I push ideas through the entire lifecycle—from architecture and deployment to maintenance and upgrade paths.
- **Pragmatic Trade-offs:** I navigate the balance between software architecture, tooling, infrastructure, and product requirements.
- **Clear Communication:** I value direct communication, explicitly stating assumptions, and making decisions based on real-world constraints.
- **Sustainable Velocity:** I iterate quickly while ensuring the underlying system remains understandable and maintainable.

## Let's Connect

I'm always interested in discussing new opportunities, complex systems, and practical engineering. If you're looking for an engineer who cares about the whole product lifecycle, let's talk.
